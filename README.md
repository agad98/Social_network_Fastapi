# Social_network_Fastapi

Hi! Welcome to my API that I built.

This API handles Posts on a feed, much like any social network.

Users can create, delete, update, and view posts. Some path operations, such as delete, require user authentication, and that was handeled with JWT tokens.

[Full documentation can be found here, you can also interact with the API, create a user, create posts, and delete them](https://gad-social-network-fastapi.herokuapp.com/docs)
